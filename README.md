WCEU2020 Contributor Day

This is hacky as a feature plugin we're missing some features.
Also it's quick and dirty as I had 3 hours to do this.

We can discuss a core implementation as soon the UI/UX folks approve this.

I'm happy to take issues on here regarding bugs, etc. But discussion should be in https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11302 and the final patch will be done there, as this feature plugin is abandoned.
